        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A simple, go-to recipe for crusty artisan bread. Uses yeast and bakes in a dutch oven. Dough can be baked immediately, but for best flavor should rest in the fridge up to 72 hours. Cooked bread can be frozen up to 3 months.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups bread flour (all purpose can be substituted 1:1)</li>
            <li>2 tsp yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <1i>1 1/2 cups very warm tap water (roughly the temperature of a bath)</1i>
            <li>1 1/2 Tbsp flour (for dusting/dough shaping)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix dough. Mix flour and salt in large bowl. Dissolve yeast in water, add water immediately to flour and salt mix, then use the handle of a wooden spoon to mix until all the flour is incorporated. Dough will be wet and sloppy – not kneadable, but not runny like cake batter. Adjust with more water or flour if needed for right consistency</li>
            <li>Rise. Cover with cling wrap or plate, leave on counter for 2 – 3 hours until it doubles in volume, it’s wobbly like jelly and the top is bubbly (see video at 24 seconds). If after 1 hour it doesn’t seem to be rising, move it somewhere warmer</li>
            <li>Refrigerate. Optional, dough can be baked immediately but will taste better if refrigerated for up to 3 days.</li>
            <li>Take chill out of refrigerated dough. If you refrigerated the dough, leave the bowl on the counter for 45-60 minutes while the oven preheats. Cold dough does not rise well.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven. Put dutch oven in oven with lid on. Preheat to 450 degrees 30 minutes prior to baking.</li>
            <li>Shape dough. Sprinkle work surface with 1 Tbsp flour, scrape dough out of bowl. Sprinkle top with 1/2 Tbsp flour.</li>
            <li>Using a dough scraper or anything of similar shape (cake server, large knife, spatula), fold the sides inwards (about 6 folds) to roughly form a roundish shape. Don’t be too meticulous here – you’re about to deform it, it’s more about deflating the bubbles in the dough and forming a shape you can move.</li>
            <li>Transfer to paper. Slide a large piece of parchment/baking paper (not wax paper) next to the dough, then flip the dough upside down onto the paper (ie seam side down, smooth side up). Slide/push it towards the middle, then reshape it into a round(ish) shape. <em>Don't get too hung up about shape. In fact, lopsided = more ridges = more crunchy bits!</em></li>
            <li>Dough in pot. Remove piping hot dutch oven from oven. Use paper to place dough into pot, place lid on.</li>
            <li>Bake 30 minutes covered, then 12 minutes uncovered or until deep golden and crispy.</li>
            <li>Cool on rack 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
